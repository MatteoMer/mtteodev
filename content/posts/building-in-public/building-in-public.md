It always has been difficult for me to be public about what I do, what I like and what I work on.  
I've never tweeted that much, never wrote about my own opinions or built some side-projects in public

In my day-to-day life I love to learn, build, think and especially I love to share it with friends!  
Funnily enough, it doesn't happen at all on the internet, where I'm almost scared to post about anything.

This is the moment where it starts to change, and I'm doing this article to make me more accountable ðŸ˜„

_Feeling like this, looking for new adventures in a place I know very well :D_


Everyday for a month, I will be publishing one new thing I learned, I built or I wrote.  

It can be anything, but it will be something.  
The endgame goal is to have a big part of my knowledge and opinions available online.

Starting today with this post, but also something I wanted to do for a while, making public my knowledge base that I use for
researching stuff I like, for now it's mostly maths related to cryptography but it will evolve with time with so many new things that I discover in my journey!  

It's available [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/matteo), please check it and let me know if you like it!

_For now my graph looks like this, hopefully if you read this in few months, it will be much bigger!_

For me this a first step into my new direction, where super exicting things will happen; but it's also a first step outside of my comfort zone.  
I can't wait to see where this will lead me, also I can't wait to share it with the world!  

The future is bright and we will build it together ðŸ«¡
