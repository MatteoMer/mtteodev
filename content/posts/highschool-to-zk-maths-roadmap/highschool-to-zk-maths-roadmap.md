In the past 9 months, I've taken some time to explore cryptography maths; and it's been amazing!

I'd like to take some time in this article to share what I've learn about the process of starting from (almost) zero and today understanding (but still struggling!) research papers.

This is not a "Frontend developer in 50 days" type of roadmap, it's more a mix of advices, resources, and of my own thoughts about how to achieve your goals in this space!

## Why do you want to learn ZK?

It's the first and probably the most important question to ask yourself, **why** are you interested in learning ZK?

I would advice you to be very honest with yourself, and there's no wrong answers. 

- Do you want to understand what is ZK because you're still unsure about why it's hype?

- Do you want to be able to read the latest research paper, because everyone is talking about it in your feed?

- Do you want to build a zk app and it's okay to take some things as a blackbox?

- Something else? 

When you have a satisfying answer, great! We can go forward :D 

## Top-down or bottom-up learning?

Now that you know what's your goal, you can take time to do a strategy!

I know two different approaches to learn ZK:
#### Top-down approach

You learn by reading/watching resources that are to simplify what is ZK, and most importantly in my opinion, being hands-on; writing circom, Noir, using SP1 or Risc-Zero!

This is a very cool approach and I think it's the best for most people!
You can commit as much time as you want to it, and whenever you want to know something in more details, you can go deeper into the ZK stack, learning step-by-step :)

As an example, it could go like this:
- You learn about ZK on twitter
- You now want to experiment and decide build a ZK fog-of-war chess game
- You discover that you can build it in Noir
- You build it!
- You then wonder what's behind Noir?
- You discover PLONK and understand that's it's a protocol
- You try to understand why it's different to other protocols 
- [...]

#### Bottom-up approach

You learn ZK by learning everything ZK is using; from abstract algebra, to pairings in EC and hopefully reading the latest research about folding!

It's, on paper, the most exciting method right? When you are "done" with it you can read any new research paper! 

But it has also serious downsides, the most obvious one: **it takes a lot of time**; like really, a lot! 

There's also a catch in this approach: you will **never** be "done" with it, there's always (always) new things that you don't know;
and the more you learn, the more you discover new things that you had no idea existed.

I have difficulties to believe that someone can do this approach while having a full-time job at the same time (would love to be proven wrong!)

## The friends we made along the way

Don't forget to make new friends along the way, this is a very lonely field, if you come from a programming background like me, none of your dev friends will understand what you're working on.

Make friends you can share your discoveries with, where you learn about fields of cryptography you've never heard of, you build side-projects with, winning hackathons, [...]

Go to conferences if you can: ZKHack, ZKSummit, ETHCC, ETH Denver, [...]


## There is no finish line
![There's no finish line](/posts/highschool-to-zk-maths-roadmap/path.jpg)  
When I started to learn crypto maths I had the idea in mind that I could "speedrun it" in way, just learning enough to understand how ZK actually worked.

It's the worst and greatest thing about cryptography, **there's no finish line**, you will _always_ get some FOMO of a new thing that everyone talks about.

## Plan
- why?
- my background
- what do you want to learn?
- from top to bottom or bottom to top?
- meet people and ask questions
- use GPT4 all the time
- a very subjective roadmap
