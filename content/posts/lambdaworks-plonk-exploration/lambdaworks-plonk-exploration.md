In this article, I'm going to do a journal of my exploration of PLONK and will try to do my own implementation using Lambdaworks primitives! I'm planning to do it in Rust, it looks like a fun challenge to do, and I know I will learn a lot doing this!

# Day 1
My first thought on this first day was pretty obvious, try to read the [PLONK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf) paper! 
But I got worried of not understanding enough on my first read so instead

I started by looking at the series of videos by David Wong, [introducing PLONK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUZcam_jrz0) until the 11th part. Up next is the copy constrainsts part of PLONK!

I took tons of notes, nothing super new on my side (I've seen this before in [Why and How zk-SNARK Works](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07221)) but this was a very good way to get all of this in my head again since this has been a while!
