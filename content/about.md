I'm a programmer that like to build cool stuff.

I do research around programmable cryptography, especially interested in real-life crypto.

Some facts:
- I did [42 Paris](https://42.fr) in 2017, where I learned how to code.
- Previously I was working at [Mazury](https://twitter.com/mazuryxyz)
- Now taking time to dive deeper in cryptography maths and core ethereum developement.
